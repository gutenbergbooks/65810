<p>The package was very tightly sealed.</p>
<p>There was a heavy cord around it fastened
with thick blobs of wax and Tad Lincoln, who
had been christened Thomas, stood fidgeting
while his father worked at it patiently, with
the old horn-handled knife that opened and
shut with a sharp click.</p>
<p>Outside was the gloom of late December.
That December of 1863, when the fortunes of
the Federal armies had taken a little swing upward,
but when war still lay like a poisonous,
tragic, and heartbreaking shadow over a whole
country. But to Tad Lincoln December meant
Christmas, and packages meant surprises, important
to a ten-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Tad stood first on one foot, then the other,
impatiently, because Papa was so slow in opening
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
this package. A round-faced boy, with his
mother&rsquo;s brown eyes and hair, he was a sturdy
figure in the miniature uniform of a Union
colonel that his father had had made for him.
The coat fitted him jauntily, all the brass buttons
fastened up in regulation fashion; there
were epaulets and braid and long trousers lying
properly over his toes, so that the copper toes
of his boots showed. He had a belt and a sword,
but he was not wearing them now. Swords were
for engagements, reviews, and parades, the
officers of Company K had instructed him.
Among friends indoors an officer took off his
belt and hung it in a safe place.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s fingers were mighty long and
bony, Tad was thinking, and awkward, too.
One thumbnail was thicker and darker than
the other nails and Tad touched it gently with
his forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes your thumb like that, Papa?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>The long yellowed hand put down the knife
and the deep-set, steel-gray eyes of Abraham
Lincoln studied the thumb intently as though
he had never seen it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once there was an ax, Tad,&rdquo; he drawled, his
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
heavy eyebrows flicking up and down, his long
mouth quirked up at one corner. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t want
to go where I aimed it, so I said, says I, now
who is boss here, Mister Ax, you or Abe Lincoln?
You chop where I aim for you to chop,
Mister Ax. So I made it hit where I wanted it to
hit but it jumped back and took a whack at me
just to show me that it could be the boss if it
wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have cut your hand off,&rdquo; worried
Tad, still rubbing the dark nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t. It was a well-meaning
ax. Just independent, like a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People take whacks at you, don&rsquo;t they? I
hear about it,&rdquo; Tad said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some of &rsquo;em do.&rdquo; Lincoln picked up the
knife again, poked at the stubborn seals. &ldquo;But
mostly afterwards they cooperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people in New York didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; insisted
Tad. &ldquo;Mother was scared to death when those
draft riots were on and people yelled at her
in that store. The police had to stand all around
us with guns and you know something? Bob
was scared but I wasn&rsquo;t. Ole Bob was plumb
scared green.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was a bad time, son.&rdquo; A seal came
loose at last and fell in scarlet fragments to the
rug. He attacked a second one, gripping the
knife, the skin stretched tight over his fleshless
knuckles. &ldquo;It was bad because people weren&rsquo;t
mad at you. They were mad at me, not at Bob
or your mother. They didn&rsquo;t want to be drafted
to fight in this war and I said they had to be
drafted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, golly, you&rsquo;ve got to have soldiers!
General Grant and General Rosecrans and
everybody are yelling for more troops. You
have to get &rsquo;em, you can&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em out of air.
Hurry and open it, Papa. Don&rsquo;t you want to see
what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what&rsquo;s in it. Yes, Tad,&rdquo; he
went on musingly, as though he talked to himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to make soldiers out of air;
anyway the New York newspapers seemed to
think so. Make &rsquo;em out of air and feed &rsquo;em on
air and give &rsquo;em air to shoot with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then if General Lee licks us you&rsquo;re to
blame!&rdquo; cried Tad. &ldquo;Oh, I know, John Hay and
Mr. Nicolay hide the papers but I find &rsquo;em.
Papa, I read where one New York paper called
you a gorilla.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Tad? Don&rsquo;t I look like
one a little?&rdquo; Lincoln dropped the knife,
shambled bent across the room, his long arms
dangling, his hands almost touching the floor.
As the boy drew back aghast he bared his long
teeth and snarled and Tad began to cry suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no! Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln laughed loudly, lifted him, setting
the lad on his knee, holding him close. &ldquo;For a
man wearing the Union uniform, you scare
easy, Colonel,&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;Remember this,
Tad. Names never hurt anybody. And the
gorilla is one beast that&rsquo;s never been tamed and
only a heavy chain can master him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the box,&rdquo; gulped Tad, scrubbing his
eyes with the cuff of his blue Union coat. &ldquo;If
anybody sent me a Christmas present, I&rsquo;d want
to know what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln dug the last seal away, cut the cord,
and tore off the heavy paper. &ldquo;Now, John Hay
would say I&rsquo;m a fool to open this,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say there could be something
in it to blind or cripple me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better not, Papa,&rdquo; Tad cried
anxiously. &ldquo;Let me call somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tad. I trust the man who brought it and
I know what&rsquo;s in it. It isn&rsquo;t a Christmas present
exactly. I earned it in a kind of a way.
Look!&rdquo; He opened the heavy box and the
smaller one inside that was covered with gold-colored
plush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A watch!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A solid gold watch.&rdquo; Lincoln held it out
carefully on his big palm. &ldquo;From Mr. James
Hoes, Esquire, of Chicago. I won it, Tad. Mr.
Hoes offered the watch as a prize for the one
making the biggest contribution of funds to
their Sanitary Commission fair. I sent them a
copy of the Emancipation Proclamation and
they auctioned it off for three thousand dollars,
so I won the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already got a watch, Papa, but I
haven&rsquo;t got one,&rdquo; said Tad eagerly.</p>
<p>Lincoln drew his old watch from his pocket,
loosed it from the chain and seals. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have
a solid gold watch. This old turnip is sort of
worn. I guess I timed too many speeches
and juries with it. But you&rsquo;re not big enough
for a watch, Tad. Not till you can wear a
vest and have enough stomach to hold up a
chain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Willie had a vest and he wasn&rsquo;t so very
much bigger than me,&rdquo; argued Tad.</p>
<p>A shadow of pain ran over his father&rsquo;s gaunt
face and the tears, always quick when any emotion
stirred him, were bright in his sunken eyes.
The agony of Willie&rsquo;s untimely death was still
raw and aching in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie was twelve years old, Tad. When you
are twelve you can have a vest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a watch. Not this one.&rdquo; Lincoln clicked
the fastening of the bright new timepiece and
dropped it into his pocket, along with the key
that wound it. &ldquo;I guess Bob will have to have
this old one. Bob&rsquo;s a man now and a man needs
a watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s a man just because he can
shave,&rdquo; Tad scoffed. He studied his father&rsquo;s
face for a moment. &ldquo;Why did you grow a beard,
Papa? You didn&rsquo;t have a beard when I was a
little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still a little boy, fellow.&rdquo; Lincoln gave
him a poke in ribs. &ldquo;Maybe I raised these
whiskers because a little girl in New York asked
me to. Maybe I just did it to keep my chin
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;All Bob has is little patches in front of his
ears. They look silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln lifted his long body erect and walked
to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be respectful to your big
brother, Tad,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;Some of the
newspapers that don&rsquo;t like me are printing that
Bob Lincoln has made a million dollars out of
this war. For a young fellow still in Harvard
only twenty years old, I&rsquo;d say he had uncanny
perspicacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, ain&rsquo;t it,
Papa?&rdquo; In his agitation the boy&rsquo;s tricky palate
betrayed him as it often did. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big, dirty
<i>rie</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s bony shoulders twitched upward,
sagged with resignation. &ldquo;Son, if all the lies
that have been printed about the Lincolns were
piled up in a heap, they&rsquo;d reach near to the top
of that monument out yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad came to stand beside him and looked
out of the half-finished shaft that would some
day honor Washington. Now it was only a
beginning, lost in a spidery web of scaffolding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be plenty tall,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If Bob had all
that money, would it reach to the top, Papa? He
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
could buy everything he wanted, couldn&rsquo;t he?
Horses and carriages and gold watches and
everything. Can&rsquo;t you put people in jail for telling
such lies? You&rsquo;re the president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln stood still, looking down on the
trampled mall where a herd of cattle pastured,
beef animals gathered to feed the Army of the
Potomac. His eyes took on the faraway inscrutable
look that so often baffled his intimates
and infuriated his enemies; the look that lost
itself on the horizon of a great land torn by hate
and drenched in an anguish of blood and fire.
Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, had
deepened that hurt in his eyes and cut new
lines about his mouth and brooding brows.
Three years of war, and in the nation there
seethed a dozen angry factions. Copperheads,
only by a miracle defeated in Ohio; furious
mobs resisting conscription in the cities; even
in the Congress, oppositionists, critics, outright
enemies.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks since, he had stood facing
that raw November wind on the Gettysburg
hill, speaking that little piece that now he was
embarrassed to remember, the speech that the
papers had dismissed as insignificant, dedicating
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the ground where slept more than sixty thousand
Union and Confederate dead. The dull
ache in Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s heart turned bitter
as he thought of his own son, who should be in
uniform and who was growing restless and unhappy
at being the one young man of army age
who was not permitted to fight for his country.
Yet he dared not let Robert enlist. The President&rsquo;s
son would be a prime hostage should he
be captured, and used no doubt to wring concessions
from his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go show Mama the watch.&rdquo; He shook
off his dismal musings and scrubbed Tad&rsquo;s
brown head with the flat of his palm, straightening
the collar of the uniform that was Tad&rsquo;s
pride and glory.</p>
<p>Tad looked up confidingly. &ldquo;You know what
Mama is worrying about, Papa? She owes an
awful lot of money in New York. She&rsquo;s afraid
you&rsquo;ll find it out. She said on the train when we
came home that I mustn&rsquo;t tell you all the things
she bought because you had troubles enough
to kill three men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln hunched a shoulder, stretching his
lips into a dry smile. &ldquo;See how my back is
breaking down, Tad? That&rsquo;s General Rosecrans.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
And this side is General McClellan and General
Meade made it worse when he let Lee get
away across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cried then, I remember. Men don&rsquo;t
cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strong men had wept enough tears to put
the Potomac in flood these last years, Lincoln
was thinking. &ldquo;When will it end?&rdquo; he said aloud,
with a groan. John Hay, his faithful secretary,
looked up quickly from his desk in the outer
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve killed all the Rebs, I reckon,&rdquo;
said Tad complacently. &ldquo;But if we killed &rsquo;em all
I&rsquo;d have a lot of uncles killed, wouldn&rsquo;t I? I
had one killed at Chickamauga already, my
uncle Helm.&mdash;He was a general,&rdquo; he told John
Hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened in a good many families,
Tad,&rdquo; Hay said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re all
Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my mother was Southern to begin
with,&rdquo; declared Tad, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m kind of half Southern
but I got over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Southerners are good folks, son,&rdquo; Lincoln
admonished him. &ldquo;Fine people most of them.
Just mistaken, that&rsquo;s all&mdash;just mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;They fight good,&rdquo; was Tad&rsquo;s comment, as
they went down the hall.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln always stepped carefully
and quietly in this big house. He had never
been at home in the White House. He always
had a secret, haunting feeling of guilt as though
he were a guest and a strange, uneasy, even an
unworthy, guest. Mary, his wife, had no such
inhibitions. She loved to sweep down the wide
stairway, her widely flounced skirts moving
elegantly over her hoops, her tight small bosom,
her round white arms and her round white
chin held proudly and complacently. All this
was her due, her manner said, and her husband&rsquo;s
humility and trick of effacing himself
occasionally irked and angered her.</p>
<p>She was writing a letter at a desk when they
entered her sitting room. The intent creases in
her brow softened as the boy ran to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Mama&mdash;look at Papa&rsquo;s new solid gold
watch! He got it for the &rsquo;Mancipation Proclamation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln pulled out the watch, grinning boyishly.
Mary&rsquo;s eyes brightened as she fingered
the handsomely engraved case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it must be terribly expensive,&rdquo; she approved.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
&ldquo;What does Tad mean about the Proclamation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent a copy to Chicago. They auctioned
it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three thousand dollars,&rdquo; added Tad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Heaven, you mean they got three thousand
dollars just for that piece of paper?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a pretty important paper, Mary, to a
million or so poor black people anyway. A copy
would be a historic memento a hundred years
from now. Understand&mdash;&rdquo; he fended off the
small glint of avidity that so often troubled
him in Mary Lincoln&rsquo;s pale gray eyes &ldquo;&mdash;this was
a charity thing. For their fair out there in
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only made one copy?&rdquo; She turned the
watch in her small, plumb fingers.</p>
<p>He hedged uneasily sensing the trend of her
thinking. &ldquo;I made one or two for old friends.
No&mdash;&rdquo; he raised a hand &ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m not making any
more, so put that idea out of your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flared. &ldquo;Why do you always accuse me
of things I&rsquo;m not even thinking?&rdquo; she cried angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe because I know you better than you
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
know yourself, my dear,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You
were thinking that this is a nice watch but that
three thousand dollars is three thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a nice watch but it never cost that
much money,&rdquo; she admitted grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, this watch was a prize. It was competition.
Anybody else could have won it, anybody
who contributed more to their fair than I
did.&rdquo; He took the watch from her hands and
slid it back to his pocket. &ldquo;Here&mdash;&rdquo; he handed
her the old one&mdash;&ldquo;put this away. You can give
it to Bob when he comes home. Run along now,
Tad, I&rsquo;ve got work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad slipped out of the room a bit disconcerted.
Mama ought not to have got mad. She
was trying not to get mad so often, his father
assured him. They had to help her, be careful
not to provoke her. Tad skittered down the long
stairs almost colliding with a workman who
carried a stepladder, with a long wreath of
greenery hung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; the boy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Christmas receptions and things.
Decorations. Don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll get it hung.
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Can&rsquo;t drive no nails in this wall. Hard as rock.
Nails just bends double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could glue it,&rdquo; suggested Tad helpfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; scorned the workman. &ldquo;Get along out
of my way, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is the President!&rdquo; stated Tad,
sternly, drawing himself up in his uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is that, but you ain&rsquo;t&mdash;nor no colonel
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so. I&rsquo;m an honorary colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it ornery and I&rsquo;ll agree. Now quit
bothering me. I&rsquo;ve got to figure where to put up
two Christmas trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; Tad&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One down here and one up yonder&mdash;private,
for you I reckon. So everybody wants to get a
favor out of your Pa can send you a present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want,&rdquo; sighed Tad, backing off to
watch the man ascend the ladder, &ldquo;is my nanny
goat back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nanny goat has likely been made into
stew by this time. You won&rsquo;t be driving a goat
team through this house any more, busting up
things and ruinin&rsquo; the floors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I bet I get her back,&rdquo; bragged Tad. &ldquo;All
Company K is helping me look for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers have got more important things to
do than hunt goats,&rdquo; stated the man from his
perch. &ldquo;They got to find out who put that bullet
through your old man&rsquo;s hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad was galvanized with excitement. &ldquo;Hey!
He never told me.&rdquo; He tore back up the stairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton, the Secretary of War, was just
coming out of his father&rsquo;s office. Tad backed
off and flattened himself against the wall. Mr.
Stanton was running the war; he was tall and
grim with a long gray beard but no mustache
to soften a stern mouth, and his eyes could look
very hard and coldly at a boy through his round
spectacles. Behind Stanton marched Senator
Sumner and Tad knew him too. Senator Sumner
was always mad about something and now, as
he strode past the boy, Tad heard him mutter
angrily, &ldquo;Amnesty! Amnesty! I&rsquo;d give North
Carolina amnesty at the end of a rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad wriggled behind the visitor and slipped
in before anyone closed the door. He marched
straight to the desk where John Hay was
putting papers in envelopes and licking the
flaps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot a bullet through my father&rsquo;s hat?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>Hay pressed down the flap with a fist. &ldquo;Who
told you that, Colonel Thomas Lincoln?&rdquo; he
inquired with careful unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me,&rdquo; stormed Tad, &ldquo;nor my
father&mdash;nor Mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t know about it. We
hope she&rsquo;ll never know. Also we hope your
father won&rsquo;t ride alone out there at the Soldier&rsquo;s
Home any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cavalry ride with him. With drawn sabers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they do. But he rode alone out there
and somebody shot a bullet through the top of
his high silk hat. He doesn&rsquo;t want his family or
anybody worried about it, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mention
it if I were you, Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tad was flattered by being addressed
as colonel, and he liked his father&rsquo;s
grave secretary. He obeyed John Hay more
readily than any one else. &ldquo;But I want to see the
hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We burned the hat. Too bad&mdash;it was a good
eight-dollar hat.&rdquo; Hay folded another sheet after
verifying the scrawled signature: <i>A. Lincoln</i>.
&ldquo;We burned it by order of the President.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Tad looked a trifle shaken. He came close
and leaned on the desk. &ldquo;Why do people want
to kill my father, Mr. Hay? They do. I know.
That&rsquo;s why we have Company K here in the
house and all over the yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Hay shook his head. &ldquo;This is war, Tad.
You could ask, why is there a war? Why are
there millions of people over there across the
river who&rsquo;d liked to blow up this town and kill
everybody in it? Everybody who stands for the
Union. Give me an answer to that and I&rsquo;ll answer
your why. It&rsquo;s a black cloud of hate, Colonel,
smothering everything decent in the
country. Maybe it will lift some day. Meanwhile
there&rsquo;s not much sense to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some of those mean Secesh over
there stole my nanny goat! I have to go out and
see if the boys have heard anything about her.
She was a nice goat. She liked me; she licked
my fingers. She wouldn&rsquo;t just run off like Papa
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; remarked Hay, &ldquo;she went over to
see why General Meade let Lee&rsquo;s army get
away from him. Go hunt your goat and don&rsquo;t
bother your father. He&rsquo;s had people swarming
in there for the last hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the women,&rdquo; observed Tad, wise beyond
his years, &ldquo;have got a boy they want to be a
colonel or a captain. And all the men want to
know why Papa doesn&rsquo;t take Richmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on out of here, Tad, or I won&rsquo;t give you
any Christmas present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I want,&rdquo; stated Tad at the
door. &ldquo;My nanny goat back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">2</span></h2>
<p>The man in the armchair across the desk
looked formidable and expensive. Abraham
Lincoln looked down at his own long, dusty,
and wrinkled black breeches and unconsciously
gave a hitch to his sagging coat, to his crooked
black satin tie that had a perverse tendency to
sidle around under his ear.</p>
<p>The visitor&rsquo;s swallow-tailed coat was pressed
and elegant; his shirt was crisp with ruffles, his
heavy watch chain held a jeweled seal. He
rested plump white hands, covered with yellow
gloves, on the gold head of a cane. His homely
face was cold-eyed and stern. He had refused
to state his errand to the people in the outer
office and Lincoln knew how thoroughly they
deplored his stubborn insistence on seeing as
many who called as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; prophesied Nicolay gloomily,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to admit the man with the little
derringer hid inside a boot, Mr. President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the fences down all around, Nicolay,
why put a bar over the one door,&rdquo; Lincoln had
argued calmly. &ldquo;If they want to kill me they
will unless you bolt me inside an iron box. I&rsquo;m
the people&rsquo;s hired man. They put me here. I
must listen to what they want to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But obviously the portly stranger in the flamboyant
apparel had little to say. He remarked
about the weather, the unfinished Capitol
dome, and the trampled mall where army beef
grazed. His chilly visage did not soften or show
animation or interest. Momentarily Lincoln expected
him to announce icily, as had happened
before, &ldquo;Mr. Lincoln, your wife owes me a large
account on which no payment has been made
for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this visitor&rsquo;s errand was financial he made
no mention of it. He stated that he was a friend
of Secretary Seward and that he had attended
the Convention at which Lincoln had been
nominated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did not vote for you, sir,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your privilege and right, sir.&rdquo; Lincoln filled
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
a little following silence by pulling out the gold
watch. &ldquo;A gift I had today. From the Chicago
Fair. Sort of a Christmas gift, I guess you&rsquo;d call
it.&rdquo; He felt as young as Tad under those coldly
scrutinizing eyes, and as na&iuml;ve and awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fitting and well deserved, Mr. President.
Now I must tell you that I have no business
here whatsoever. I merely came here to
tell you that I believe you are doing all for the
good of the country that it is in the power of
man to do. And I want to say to you, Mr. President&mdash;go
ahead, do as you darned well please
and I will support you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s rare laughter whooped. He sprang
up and pumped the hand of the startled
stranger. John Hay put an inquiring head in at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; chortled the President, &ldquo;came
here deliberately and on purpose to tell me that
I was running this country right&mdash;and all the
while I thought he&rsquo;d come to tell me how to
take Richmond. Sit down, sir, sit down! I have
not seen enough of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. President,&rdquo; protested the visitor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
&ldquo;are words of approval so rare and exciting
to the President of the United States?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rare?&rdquo; Lincoln dropped back to his chair,
his face collapsing into a sudden, melancholy
mask. &ldquo;John, show this man that copy of the
New York <i>Herald</i>&mdash;the one where they call me
a fiend and a disgrace to humanity because I
set human beings free from slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I destroyed it, Mr. President,&rdquo; Hay said. &ldquo;I
was afraid that the infamous thing might be
seen by some of your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Useless precaution, Johnny. I have a son
in Boston, and I suspect that he keeps his
mother supplied with interesting clippings. My
friend, if to be the big boss of Hell is as tough
as what I have to undergo here, I can feel
mighty sorry for Satan. Come along and have
lunch with me, if you will, sir. I reckon they&rsquo;ve
put the big pot in the little one by this time.
John, will you see if Mrs. Lincoln is ready for
lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Mrs. Lincoln went out, Mr. President.
Mr. Nicolay ordered out the carriage and
the black team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And an escort?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir&mdash;the lieutenant arranged an escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary would like that, Abraham Lincoln was
thinking as they went down the chilly stairs.
Fires burned in all the rooms but the ceilings
were high and the walls cold and this was a
bleak day with the lowering chill of late December.
A few snowflakes timidly rode down the
icy air, but Mary would wrap herself in rich
furs, her round pink face nestled in a deep collar,
a stylish bonnet perched on her smooth
dark hair.</p>
<p>With white-gloved hands&mdash;smooth now, but
once they had known a time of rough domestic
toil&mdash;she would wave brief salutes to the people
in the street. He hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t be
haughty about it. He knew her shyness and uncertainty,
her feeling of insecurity in a high
place for which she had had so little training,
and that too often she hid this uncertainty behind
a too glib, too tart attitude of arrogance.
To Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s eyes, to his sensitive
insight, it was like seeing a nervous little hen
strut and bridle surrounded by the cold angry
eyes of foxes and the sharp talons of hawks.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
There were, unhappily, too many people who
misunderstood Mary Todd Lincoln.</p>
<p>Even John Hay had little sympathy for the
President&rsquo;s wife. There had been a scrap of
paper that Lincoln had found once, part of a
letter Hay had begun and discarded calling
Mary a &ldquo;Hellcat&rdquo; and adding dryly that she was
lately more &ldquo;hellcatical&rdquo; than usual.</p>
<p>Too bad Mary occasionally indulged in temper
tantrums in the executive offices. Her small
explosions, her husband knew, were a form of
relief for the eternally seething doubts of herself
that tormented her. She adored her husband
and the two boys that had been spared to
them, but this love was fiercely jealous and
possessive and not always wise or controlled.</p>
<p>Christmas would be a sad time for Mary.
Last year Willie had been here, the gentle,
quiet brown-haired boy who spent so many
hours curled up in a chair with a book. Willie
had known every railroad line, every station on
every line. He had learned timetables by heart
and drawn up schedules of his own. It had been
just such a raw, dreary day as this last February
when Willie had gone riding out on his pony.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
He had come home soaked and chilled and the
nightmare of those next days would haunt
Abraham Lincoln as long as he lived&mdash;Willie,
burning with fever, babbling incoherencies;
Mary sobbing and moaning, pacing the floor,
her hands in taut, agonized fists, her smooth
hair wild over her tear-streaked cheeks; and
that ghastly night of the White House ball, with
the Marine Band playing, he himself having to
shake hands endlessly at the door of the East
Room while Willie fought for breath upstairs.</p>
<p>After that, the end. The blue eyes closed and
sunken, fading flowers pressed by Mary into
the small cold hands, senators, generals, foreign
ministers, pressing the numb hand of the
President of the United States, while upstairs
on her bed Mary writhed and wailed in uncontrolled
grief.</p>
<p>Now Christmas would bring it all back. He
was glad that Mary could forget for a little
while, shopping, buying gifts for Tad who had
too much already, who was in a fair way to be
badly spoiled.</p>
<p>Deeply, poignantly, Abraham Lincoln
dreaded Christmas. All over the land, north
and south, would lie a load of sorrow like a
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
grim hand pressing the heart of America, the
heart of this tall grave man in the White House.
He felt that burden as he walked into the small
dining room. Mary had not returned. Tad slid
in late and was sent out again to wash himself.
The stranger waxed garrulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Mr. President, that you have
a plan to widen the breach between Governor
Vance of North Carolina and Jefferson Davis,
president of this so-called Confederacy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Lincoln, &ldquo;turned out not too
well. Gilmore, of the New York <i>Tribune</i>, wrote
too much and prematurely. Those fellows across
the river got riled up and a Georgia regiment
started a riot in Raleigh in September and
burned the Raleigh <i>Standard</i>. So the citizens
of Raleigh who didn&rsquo;t have faith in Jeff Davis
rose up and burned the Confederate newspaper,
the <i>State Journal</i>. That widened the breach
and Vance has already told Jeff Davis that he
would welcome reunion with the Union states
and any peace compatible with honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught John Hay&rsquo;s warning look then and
said no more. He would not reveal that his
agents has just brought in a letter sent by the
Governor of North Carolina to Jefferson Davis&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
bold and open plea for negotiation with the
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If North Carolina would make the break it
would be a long step toward peace,&rdquo; said his
guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could also mean anarchy, outrages, and
destruction in that state, calling for more Union
troops,&rdquo; Hay reminded them. &ldquo;So far we have
pushed back the borders of this rebellion,
opened the Mississippi, and our Navy has
tightened the blockade of all the Southern
ports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not, even under pressure, revoke
the Emancipation Proclamation, Mr. President?&rdquo;
The visitor was anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never revoke that Proclamation, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the meal ended and the guest had
taken an obsequious departure, Lincoln
stopped at Hay&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that fellow sent here to find out,
Johnny? Was he sent by Sumner, you think, to
put in a word against my idea of amnesty for
any Southern state that wants to come back into
the Union? Sumner wants &rsquo;em all hung down
there and he has some powerful newspapers
behind him. Some of &rsquo;em are saying I&rsquo;m having
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
my salary raised to a hundred thousand dollars
a year, that I&rsquo;m drawing it in gold while the
Army gets paid in greenbacks, and that I&rsquo;ve
cooked up a scheme to have Congress declare
me perpetual president for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you let such fantastic rumors disturb
you, Mr. Lincoln?&rdquo; Hay protested. &ldquo;That
New York <i>World</i> editorial saying you&rsquo;ve done
a fine job and that your death would only
prolong the war has been reprinted all over the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my death would end this war, John, I&rsquo;d
give my life gladly,&rdquo; Lincoln declared solemnly.
&ldquo;That would be a fine Christmas gift for
this country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">3</span></h2>
<p>The soldiers of Company K One Hundred
and Fiftieth Pennsylvania Volunteers had become
practically a part of the White House
family. Abraham Lincoln treated them as
though they were his own sons, called most of
them by their first names, personally arranged
for their passes and furloughs.</p>
<p>So when Mary Todd Lincoln had all her
shopping purchases carried up to the family
sitting room and displayed, Lincoln&rsquo;s face wore
a sober look of disappointment. Mary was tired
and on edge but she excitedly showed him, one
after another, the toys she had bought for Tad,
the gifts for Robert, and a few items for members
of the household staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Abraham, this gun&mdash;it fires like a real
cannon! With smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for the boys?&rdquo; he asked, rubbing
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
his long hands over his knees, a characteristic
nervous gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve just showed you&mdash;the wallet and
cuff buttons for Bob and all these&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean <i>my</i> boys. The Company K boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary stared incredulously. &ldquo;Good Heavens&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t give Christmas presents to a whole
company of soldiers! There must be a hundred
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there were,&rdquo; he said heavily. &ldquo;I wish
every company in our army was full strength
but unfortunately they&rsquo;re far short in numbers.
There are less than forty of those boys and
they&rsquo;re far from home and Christmas is a bad
time to be homesick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could be worse off,&rdquo; she snapped.
&ldquo;They could be out there along the Rappahannock
or down in those marshes of Mississippi.
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s not so far. Lord knows you&rsquo;re
always fixing up furloughs for them so they can
go home. Why, it would cost a fortune to give
gifts to all that company&mdash;and anyway, what
can you give a soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some warm socks might come in good. That
ground&rsquo;s frozen out there and it&rsquo;s likely to
snow hard any day now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;The commissary should keep them in socks.&rdquo;
She was testy as always in the face of criticism.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I do enough&mdash;going out to those horrid
hospitals twice a week&mdash;carrying things&mdash;this
house is practically stripped of bed linen, all
torn up for bandages.&rdquo; She fluttered about her
purchases, flushed and breathless, her hands
making little snatching gestures, picking up
things, putting them down again, twisting
string around her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very noble of you, indeed,&rdquo; he approved.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of what you do but I&rsquo;m still thinking
about Joe and Nate and those other boys. They
curry horses and clean harness and saddles;
they look after Tad and his goat&mdash;and of course
they&rsquo;re always on guard for fear I&rsquo;ll get shot,
though I can&rsquo;t figure any place where I could
be where nobody could get at me, unless they
buried me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man, that one-eyed man, you&rsquo;re crazy
to let him come here!&rdquo; Mary cried. &ldquo;Mr. Nicolay
says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gurowski? I know.&rdquo; He smiled patiently. &ldquo;If
anybody does the Democrats a favor by putting
a bullet in my head it might very well be Gurowski.
He croaks that the country is marching
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
to it&rsquo;s tomb and that Seward and McClellan
and I are the gravediggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be digging your grave if you don&rsquo;t
have a care for yourself!&rdquo; Her volatile mood
had shifted; she was almost in tears. &ldquo;That horrible
creature with those old green goggles, that
silly red vest and that big hat and cape&mdash;he
looks like Satan himself, yet you listen to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his hired man, Mary,&rdquo; Lincoln repeated.
&ldquo;The bald-headed old buzzard is smart
enough. He had a good job working under
Horace Greeley on the <i>Tribune</i>, but they had to
let him go because he couldn&rsquo;t distinguish
truth from slander. Then Seward put him in the
State Department as a translator but he published
so many slurs about Seward and me that
they dismissed him from that job. He started
as a revolutionary in Europe; now he thinks he
can save this nation. Maybe by eliminating me.
He&rsquo;s written down now as a dangerous character.
He won&rsquo;t be allowed in here again, so don&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary would never worry long, he knew. She
was too mercurial, too easily diverted by trifles.
What troubled Lincoln most was her impulsive
inclination to meddle. She took a hand in decisions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
was always writing indiscreet letters to
newspaper editors, discussing national affairs
too brashly; she interfered in decisions over
post offices and appointments to military academies.
When New York papers printed long
items about her travels, her clothes, her bonnets
and baggage, she was flattered and excited, unaware
that her husband was unhappily reading
into some of these accounts an amused note of
criticism and contempt. She was as much a
child as Tad, he told himself often, but unlike
Tad she could not be controlled.</p>
<p>All through the evening she busied herself
happily over her gifts, wrapping them in white
paper, fetching bits of ribbon from her dozens
of bandboxes for bows and decorations. Abraham
Lincoln slipped off his elastic-sided shoes
and stretched his bony feet to the fire. He dozed
a little and had to be warned sharply by Mary
when his gray wool socks began to smoke a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, Abraham, you&rsquo;d burn yourself to
a cinder if I didn&rsquo;t look after you! You&rsquo;ve even
scorched your pantaloons. Yes, you have. I can
see where the broadcloth is singed on that right
leg. It&rsquo;s like putting ribbons on a pig to try to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
dress you up decently. Sometimes I despair of
ever making you into a real gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln smacked absently at the hot fabric
of his breeches. &ldquo;In this town, Mary, gentlemen
are as thick as fleas in a dog pound. Take credit
for making me into a man but let the fashionable
aspect go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People can&rsquo;t see how much you know,&rdquo; she
argued. &ldquo;All they see is how you look. No wonder
that New York paper called you a &lsquo;pathetic,
disheveled figure&rsquo; when you made that speech
at Gettysburg. I suppose your cravat was
crooked and your socks falling down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve called me worse things. Names
don&rsquo;t stick unless your hide is soft. I got toughened
up back yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice you act kind of flattered when they
call you a railsplitter&mdash;and a yokel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know I was a good railsplitter. If
they called me a sorry railsplitter I&rsquo;d resent it.&rdquo;
He was unperturbed. &ldquo;What is a yokel? A fellow
from the country. So I must be a yokel for I
sprung from about as deep in the country as you
can get air to breathe, so deep there wasn&rsquo;t even
a road there, just an old trace that meandered
up the bed of the crick part of the way. America&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
made of yokels. Our side, anyway. Your
friends down South have got a few stylish gentlemen
but a lot of them lost their sashes and
their plumes up at Gettysburg and they got
buried right alongside the yokels. Humiliating
to them, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hopeless, Abe Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know you&rsquo;d admire me a heap more if
I could go around like Jim Buchanan. Long-tailed
coat and white vest and my head cocked
to one side like a tom turkey admiring all the
gals. He brought plenty of elegance to this office
but if he&rsquo;d had a little yokel grit in his gizzard
the country wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess, maybe.
One thing I know, you wouldn&rsquo;t want me sashaying
around the gals like Buchanan. You&rsquo;d
spit fire if I commenced that. Go on and fuss at
me, Mary; it don&rsquo;t bother me and I can still lick
salt off the top of your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled the cord of the little toy cannon
and aimed it at him. The cork that was fired
from it hit him in the stomach and he bent over,
pretending to be mortally wounded, uttering
grotesque groans. She clutched at him abruptly,
holding both his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like my
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his arms around her, pressed her head
against his chest. &ldquo;You having dreams again? I
thought you&rsquo;d quit that foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the same one, over and over. I can&rsquo;t
see you but I can hear you groaning&mdash;like that.
And I wake up in a cold sweat feeling something
warm on my hands&mdash;like blood!&rdquo; she moaned
shuddering.</p>
<p>He patted her head soberly. &ldquo;You eat too
many cakes at parties. Too much syllabub.
Getting fat, too.&rdquo; He pinched her playfully.
&ldquo;Me now, I&rsquo;m one of Pharaoh&rsquo;s lean kine. More
bones than a shad and they all poke out and rattle.
You should have married a pretty little
feller, somebody like Steve Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want him. I wanted you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you got me, Mary, not anything extra
of a bargain but I did set you up so high you
couldn&rsquo;t go higher unless you got made queen
of some place. You&rsquo;re a queen now, queen of a
torn and divided country all drowned in sorrow
and hate and woe. But it won&rsquo;t always be like
that.&mdash;I wish to the Lord I knew what to do
about that little man, Ulysses S. Grant! I reckon
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
I&rsquo;ll just have to give him command of the
army.&rdquo; He put her gently aside, letting care
return to possess him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a fine soldier but he&rsquo;s a dirty,
drunken little man,&rdquo; sniffed Mary, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
like his wife either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fights better, dirty and drunk, than a lot
of elegant fellers I&rsquo;ve got in commands. If he
can win battles he can go dirty as a hog and it
won&rsquo;t degrade him any in my estimation,&rdquo; Lincoln
declared. &ldquo;As for his wife, you&rsquo;ve got a bad
habit of not liking wives, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. I like some of their wives&mdash;when
they&rsquo;re not cold and distant and look
down their noses. It&rsquo;s because I know how to
buy pretty clothes and my bonnets become me.
I do look nice when I&rsquo;m dressed up, Abe Lincoln.
And I know how to behave in company.
After all there is a little respect due to my position,&rdquo;
she stated, complacently.</p>
<p>He gave her a comradely pat and went back
to his chair and the stack of papers he had put
aside. &ldquo;All right, Mama, you do the peacocking
for this office and I&rsquo;ll try to win the war,&rdquo; he
said, withdrawing into that remoteness that
always baffled her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">4</span></h2>
<p>Desperately she wanted to be liked
and admired. She did not even know that this
desire tormented her like a hidden thorn. It
was lost under the surface imperiousness that
she had put on defensively, as a child might
dress up in a trailing robe and play at being
queen. She had no talent for adjustment or reconciliation
and her husband&rsquo;s propensity for
seeing the best in people, even his bitterest enemies,
puzzled and irritated her. In her mind she
put this down as weakness. When she disliked
anyone, it was done with vigor and she made
no secret of it. When she was displeased she let
the whole world know, yet she could not understand
why it was that she felt always alone.</p>
<p>The Christmas party at the White House had
to be important, if not gay. State Department
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
people, Supreme Court people, senators, generals
and their wives, would not expect hilarity.
Not with Lee&rsquo;s menacing army so near, the
carnage of Chickamauga so recent, all the factional
strife in New York and Missouri and
Ohio only temporarily lulled, and definitely,
Mary suspected, not defeated.</p>
<p>She had two dresses spread out on her bed,
and Elizabeth Heckley, the mulatto seamstress,
pinned bits of lace and ribbon bows here and
there over the voluminous folds of coral-colored
satin and purple velvet. The satin had
wide bands of heavy embroidery touched with
gold around the skirt and the folds that draped
low over the shoulders. Elizabeth fastened a
garland of roses at the bosom of that dress and
let it trail down the side of the skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needs a gold breastpin right there,&rdquo; she indicated
the fastening place of the flowers.
&ldquo;What Mrs. President goin&rsquo; to wear on her
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A turban, Lizzie, of this same satin with
some pale blue feathers in front and the roses
hanging down over my chignon. This dress will
have to be for the Christmas party and I know
it&rsquo;s too gay and likely I&rsquo;ll be criticized for putting
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
off my mourning for poor little Willie.
Good gracious, down home where I was raised,
I&rsquo;d wear black for three solid years for a child
and for a husband it was forever. But I look
awful in black and I know it. It makes me
dumpy and sallow and I do owe something to
the people. There&rsquo;s too much crepe already in
Washington. It depresses people and hurts the
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This other one would look mighty fine on
you, Mrs. President.&rdquo; The seamstress lovingly
stroked the folds of violet velvet. &ldquo;This dress
look like it was made for a queen.&rdquo; There were
bands of embroidery on this gown too, but the
embroidery was all gold cord and beads and
there was a light overskirt of draped tulle in
shades of lilac, lavender, and purple, caught up
with little knots of gold leaves.</p>
<p>A queen! Abraham had called her a queen.
Mary could see herself trailing a long robe of
crimson with a border of gold and ermine. Too
bad democracies did not favor such ornate display
by their rulers&mdash;but the purple velvet did
have a regal look. She would wear plumes in
her headdress, three of them in the three shades
of the overskirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear this at the New Years&rsquo; reception,
though it is a pity to waste anything so handsome
on a company of just anybody. See about
some feathers and gold trimmings for my headdress,
Lizzie, and plenty of white gloves. Last
year I ruined four pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must see to it that Abraham had plenty
of gloves, too. He hated them; he was always
pulling them off and stuffing them untidily into
a pocket. He was always bursting them, too,
and she kept spare pairs handy. His hands had
a tendency to swell from prolonged handshaking
and inevitably the buttons popped off or the
seams split. A pair would be soiled in half an
hour too from all those hands, some calloused,
some grimy, some too hot and eager.</p>
<p>The New Year&rsquo;s reception was a great nuisance
in Mary&rsquo;s book&mdash;those tramping feet scuffing
the floors and the carpets and almost invariably
it snowed. And in spite of the vigilance
of the guards she knew there was danger.
Lately danger had become a haunting oppression
to Mary Todd Lincoln.</p>
<p>The election of 1864 was coming up and even
in the Union states there was radical opposition
so bold it verged on treason, not to overlook
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the vicious attacks of the newspapers to the
South. On those pages Abraham Lincoln was
called everything from a degraded idiot to
Mephistopheles reincarnate. The South, as
Southern-bred Mary Lincoln knew well, was
full of impetuous hotheads ready to dare or to
do anything for their sacred Cause. There was
that O&rsquo;Neale Greenhow woman, arrested right
here in sight of the White House&mdash;and even the
Mayor of Washington temporarily lodged in
jail. And they said that people right in the
Provost Office had supplied the Greenhow
woman with information that had brought on
so many Union defeats at Manassas and other
battles. Mary remembered having once met
Rose O&rsquo;Neale Greenhow at a tea somewhere.
A handsome and arrogant woman, too friendly
with men. She was banished South of the lines
now, but women like that always had impetuous
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me out something plain, Lizzie,&rdquo; she
ordered now. &ldquo;I have to shop again this afternoon.
The President thinks every soldier in
Company K must have a Christmas gift, and
where I&rsquo;ll find things the Lord only knows!
&lsquo;Socks,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Wool socks.&rsquo; I doubt if any can
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
be found, and they&rsquo;d be two dollars a pair if
there are any. Anyway, cakes and candy and
tobacco&mdash;and all those getting harder and
harder to get. The crowds in the streets are getting
so rough, too, with all these soldiers coming
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could go, Mrs. Lincoln,&rdquo; offered Elizabeth,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d tell me what to buy and give me
an order to have it charged&mdash;and send somebody
to help carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, Lizzie?&rdquo; Mary was eager with
relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you in a carriage and a boy
with you. I have to make a list. I think we&rsquo;ll
forget the socks&mdash;there might not be any and
anyway their mothers ought to knit socks for
them. We wouldn&rsquo;t know sizes anyway.&rdquo; Mary
fluttered, hunting pen and paper, sending a
maid to order the carriage, getting out a heavy
cape of her own to keep the sewing woman
warm. &ldquo;You go down to the market, Lizzie,
away down on D Street. Things will be cheaper
there. There are thirty-three of those men. Just
so each one had some little remembrance the
President will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was grateful not to have to brave again
the streets of Washington that were becoming
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
more horrible every day. Deep mud, which
Army wagons were churning up, caissons
pounding by, cavalry splashing everybody, and
soldiers crowding everywhere. The shops were
always crowded with the impatient, pushing
military and Negroes, and more colored people
were thronging into the capital every day,
homeless and bewildered. Some of the Negro
men were being integrated into the Army but
most were a problem that the provosts and
police were coping with in desperate confusion.</p>
<p>It all made for discomfort and danger. No
real indignity had as yet been offered to her
personally since those grim days in New York
in July, when she had been hooted in the
streets and followed into a shop by a jeering
mob of ruffians. Here in Washington her greatest
cross was the thinly veiled contempt of the
women, formerly socially important, the women
the President called &ldquo;those Secesh dames.&rdquo;
Very boldly they let it be known that their
sympathies were with the South.</p>
<p>Washington, Mr. Seward said, and Mr. Stanton
agreed with him, was a nest of spies. In
spite of imprisonment, grim guards, and ceaseless
precautions, messages still went through
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
the lines to Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis.
It was said that Fontaine Maury, the Confederate
admiral, had a direct pipeline into the
very heart of the Capitol. Suspicion and distrust
were rampant, and Mary harbored a constant,
nervous fear that either she or Tad might
be kidnapped by the Rebels and held as hostages.</p>
<p>She had wondered sometimes in moments of
private bitterness just how much Abraham Lincoln
would surrender to get his wife back, but
Tad was the key to his heart. Lately Company
K had had orders to keep close surveillance
over the boy but Tad was quick and mobile as
a flea. Less than a month before he had been
brought back, shouting protests and struggling,
from climbing the scaffolding of the half-finished
Washington Monument.</p>
<p>She must go out and appear at the receptions
and teas planned by wives of officials, but with
Christmas at hand now there would be a hiatus
in festivities until after the New Year reception
at the White House. There was that tiresome
affair to plan for, then this Christmas party; it
was all hard work and expensive too, and that
aspect practical Mary Lincoln always considered
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
seriously. She never saw an elaborate collation
spread without secretly adding up in her
mind how many bonnets, bracelets, and yards
of silk could have been bought with the money.</p>
<p>The Christmas tree in the private sitting
room upstairs had been set up and Tad put to
work stringing popcorn and bits of bright metal
for decorations. A corporal had brought in a
sackful of scraps of brass discarded by a cartridge
manufacturer and these Tad was tying
to lengths of his mother&rsquo;s red wool. He insisted
on doing all this in his father&rsquo;s office, stepped
over by the endless streams of officials and callers,
and Mary found him there, squatting behind
Lincoln&rsquo;s desk, surrounded by the litter of
his festive preparations.</p>
<p>She entered as usual without knocking, made
a brief stiff bow to Noah Brooks, the correspondent
from the West Coast, and puckered
her brows at the small woman with curling
grayish hair and unfashionable bonnet who occupied
the one comfortable chair in the room.</p>
<p>The President unlimbered his long legs and
jumped up, as did Brooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in, my dear!&rdquo; he greeted his
wife. &ldquo;You know Mr. Brooks&mdash;and Mary, this is
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the little woman
who wrote the book that started a big war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stowe held out a gloved hand. &ldquo;I am
happy to be privileged to meet Mrs. Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read your book, Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Mary was gracious.
&ldquo;I cried over it, some parts&mdash;but part of
it made me mad, too. My family owned slaves,
Mrs. Stowe, but they never did beat them or
set dogs on them&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must emphasize the wrong sometimes,
Mrs. Lincoln, to bring about what is right,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Stowe. &ldquo;Undoubtedly your family
were Christian people, and exceptional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mama!&rdquo; wailed Tad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing on
my yarn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only came,&rdquo; Mary was flustered, &ldquo;to report
to my husband that I have arranged Christmas
gifts for his soldiers&mdash;as he requested,&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here, Mrs. Lincoln,&rdquo; Brooks offered his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, you have business here. Happy to
have met you, Ma&rsquo;am. You must stay and have
dinner with us.&rdquo; Mary bowed again and hoped
she had made a graceful exit as became a queen.</p>
<p>She wondered, as she went down the hall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
why women with brains always looked a little
frumpy. That dress&mdash;homemade, probably, and
it didn&rsquo;t fit anywhere! It was, she decided, safe
to leave a woman of as few charms as Mrs.
Harriet Beecher Stowe in the office, especially
chaperoned by Noah Brooks. But Mary Lincoln
knew well that if Mrs. Stowe had been
young and pretty she herself would never have
walked out of that office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">5</span></h2>
<p>The boy who jumped out of the dark
shadow of the bushes slapped his rifle hard,
brought it to port sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;if I had been
an assassin you&rsquo;d be dead by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln stopped, shifted his high
hat. A few thin flakes of snow lay white against
the silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you have been doing, Joe,
while an assassin was making a corpse out of
me?&rdquo; he asked amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have done the best I could to protect
you, Mr. President, but it&rsquo;s powerful dark out
here,&rdquo; stammered the flustered soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you were here, Joe, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be
out here,&rdquo; Lincoln said. &ldquo;Cold out here. Have
you got some warm gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t handle a gun with gloves, Mr. President.
But I get relieved in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln looked at the sky. &ldquo;Some mean
weather making up, I&rsquo;m afraid. Bad for
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Christmas. You boys keeping warm in those
tents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the way I figure, sir, we&rsquo;re just as
warm as those men of General Meade&rsquo;s over
across the river. And there ain&rsquo;t nobody shooting
at us, sir&mdash;I mean, Mr. President. The lieutenant
ain&rsquo;t going to like it, Mr. President, you
walking out here alone. You want to walk, you
need a couple of us boys along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make a good mark, don&rsquo;t I, Joe? I sort of
rear up on the skyline like a steeple. Good thing
it&rsquo;s too dark for them to spot me. I look at it
this way. If the good Lord wants me to stay on
this job He&rsquo;ll look after me. God and Company
K. You see Tad anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mr. President.&rdquo; Joe stalked beside
the tall figure, weapon alerted. &ldquo;Tad&rsquo;s down
yonder to the corporal&rsquo;s tent. He&rsquo;s got his billy
goat down there. Some of the boys fixed up an
army cap for that goat and the corporal&rsquo;s riveting
a chin strap on it.&rdquo; Joe trotted a little to
keep up with the long stride of Lincoln.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better anchor it tight or the goat will eat his
headgear,&rdquo; remarked Lincoln. &ldquo;Mrs. Lincoln
sent Tad to bed so she could fix up his Christmas
presents. Tad always sleeps with me but
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
when I went to my room he wasn&rsquo;t there, so I
decided he&rsquo;d slipped down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goat sure means a lot to Tad, Mr. President.
Tad treats him like he was folks. Nobody
ever has found out what happened to the she-goat,
sir. Last pass you give me I went all over
that skinny town back yonder where the trash
and niggers live but I never seen a sign of any
goat&mdash;hide neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad misses his brother. Christmas will be a
sad time for all of us, but we&rsquo;ll try to make it
happy for Tad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about a year ago you lost your boy,
wasn&rsquo;t it, Mr. President?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last February. Lung fever. He got wet and
took a cold. Mrs. Lincoln hasn&rsquo;t gotten over it
at all. She idolized her sons. We lost another
one, you know, in Springfield. Little Eddie.
But we have company, Joe. A great sorrowful
company of people who have lost their sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln sighed heavily as he strode up to the
lighted tent where a group of men hunkered
down around Tad and his goat.</p>
<p>The corporal dropped his awl and leather
and jumped up, eyes bulging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; he barked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Every man sprang up to stand stiffly. Tad
threw his arms around the goat, yelling desperately.
&ldquo;Help me hold him! He&rsquo;ll get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ease, boys,&rdquo; Lincoln said &ldquo;Grab that
goat, some of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mr. President, sir,&rdquo; gulped the corporal.
&ldquo;Get him, Bullitt. You, Joe&mdash;you&rsquo;re on
post!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; Lincoln said, &ldquo;has been escorting me
and protecting me from assassins, my orders.
Very capably too. Tad, you&rsquo;d better come along
to bed. Tomorrow is Christmas and your
brother will be here on an early train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mr. President.&rdquo; The corporal flicked
a salute importantly. &ldquo;Lieutenant detailed me
and three of the boys to meet that train. We
was just helping the boy here to pretty up his
goat, sir, asking your pardon and meaning no
offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offense taken, Corporal. I appreciate
your taking care of my boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Papa,&rdquo; shrilled Tad, &ldquo;lookit Billy&rsquo;s
horns.&rdquo; The animal&rsquo;s rough pointed horns had
been painted a bright scarlet and tipped with
circles of brass. He shook them impatiently
while Tad clung to his neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty pretty,&rdquo; approved his father, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;re getting paint on your uniform jacket.
Your mama will have something to say about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have a duck fit,&rdquo; stated Tad disrespectfully;
then his voice sank to a whimper.
&ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s pretty but he&rsquo;s not as pretty as a nanny
goat, Papa. I want my nanny goat back.&rdquo; He
began to cry thinly, and the corporal looked
anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure wish we could get his nanny goat
back, Mr. President. That paint will dry by
morning, sir. We&rsquo;ll tie Billy out where he can&rsquo;t
rub it off on anything. You, Bullitt and Gibson,
escort the President and young Mr. Lincoln
back to the house, and lemme see them rifles
first. Half the time,&rdquo; he explained unhappily,
&ldquo;they ain&rsquo;t got no load ready and a man might
as well carry a broomstick. All right. About
face, March!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad clung to his father&rsquo;s hand and Lincoln
felt his palm sticky with undried paint. Behind
them the goat blatted forlornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants me,&rdquo; mourned Tad. &ldquo;I feed him
biscuits and all the boys have got is hardtack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find some biscuits,&rdquo; suggested
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Lincoln. &ldquo;Mr. Bullitt and Mr. Gibson
can carry them back to him. Come along in,
boys, and report back to your corporal that I&rsquo;m
much obliged for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never set foot in the White House
kitchen. Now Abraham Lincoln walked timidly
there as though he were an intruder who might
be ordered out indignantly at any moment.</p>
<p>The long room, still odorous with baking
bread and roasting meat, was warm, the huge
ranges clinking as they cooled, water dripping
from the spout of a pump. The cooks&rsquo; white
aprons and caps hung from pegs on the wall
and one long table was covered with trays
spread over with white cloths. Lincoln lifted
a corner of a covering. Beneath was a great
array of small colored cakes obviously baked
for the Christmas party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have one, boys.&rdquo; He took a pink dainty himself
and bit into it. &ldquo;Pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad wolfed down two and the privates nervously
accepted one each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where they keep the biscuits?&rdquo; Tad
began to explore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You
snoop everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Tad scurried about, opening ovens and cupboards,
lifting lids of boxes and the great copper
pots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread,&rdquo; he uncovered a stack of loaves, &ldquo;but
no biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your billy will eat bread, sir,&rdquo; suggested
Private Bullitt. &ldquo;He eats hardtack. He&rsquo;ll eat
anything, Mr. President. He ate Sergeant
Whipple&rsquo;s box from home. Had a cake in it. Et
box and all, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well have to see to it that Sergeant Whipple
gets another cake.&rdquo; Lincoln took down a
long knife from a rack on the wall and whacked
off the end of a loaf of fresh bread. &ldquo;Good
bread.&rdquo; He tasted a crumb. &ldquo;Go good if we had
some jam to put on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s jampots up there, Papa.&rdquo; Tad
pointed to a high shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are.&rdquo; Lincoln reached a long arm,
slit the paper that covered the top of a jar,
dipped in a knife. &ldquo;Blackberry.&rdquo; He sliced off a
hunk of bread, spread it thickly with jam,
handed it to Private Bullitt. &ldquo;Have some, boys.&rdquo;
He spread another slice for Gibson and one for
Tad and himself. Perched on the edge of a table
he ate, wiped his beard and fingers on a handy
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
towel, passed the towel around. &ldquo;Some drizzled
on your jacket, Tad. Wipe it off. Now, I reckon
somebody will get blamed for this piece of
larceny, so I&rsquo;d better take care of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cooks&rsquo; pad and pencil lay on a shelf and
Lincoln tore off a sheet and wrote rapidly: <i>All
provisions missing from this kitchen requisitioned
by order of the undersigned. A. Lincoln.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;That will fix it. You boys take this bread
back to that billy goat and tell your sergeant I&rsquo;ll
see that he&rsquo;s recompensed for his lost cake,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Now Tad, you come along to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wreaths of greenery were in place in the
hall and up the stairs, and in the East Room
a tall spruce tree awaited the lighting of the
candles. Festival! And out there on the cold
ground boys like Robert, boys like Tad would
soon grow to be, kept warm in flimsy tents with
little fires, slept on straw with blankets far too
thin, and there were men he knew in the field,
in grim military prisons, who likely had no
blankets at all.</p>
<p>The great bed in his room with its huge, soft
bolster and tufted counterpane, its enormous
headboard shutting off drafts and elaborately
carved and scrolled, suddenly wore the aspect
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
of sinful luxury. He would gladly have taken
a blanket and gone out to join his men, but he
knew sadly that that would not do. He had
known the ground for a bed many times&mdash;in the
Black Hawk War and on expeditions into the
wilds&mdash;but now he was growing old and he had
to uphold the dignity of high office.</p>
<p>He pulled off Tad&rsquo;s clothes, buttoned him
into a long nightshirt, and tucked him into the
big bed. Almost instantly the boy was asleep.
Lincoln was struggling with his own boots
when the door opened and Mary came in, buttoned
into a vast blue wrapper, a ruffled cap on
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forevermore!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Where have
you been? I looked for you to help me with the
Christmas things and couldn&rsquo;t find a hair of you
or Tad either. Has that child been out in this
cold wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were having a little Christmas party
with some of the boys, Mary. Tad&rsquo;s all right.
Don&rsquo;t start scolding tonight; it&rsquo;s already Christmas
morning now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how delicate he is. It will be just
like Willie all over again and I can&rsquo;t bear any
more sorrow, Abraham. I&rsquo;ll lose my mind if I
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
have another grief to live through,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad&rsquo;s tough, Mama. Not frail like Willie.
We were in the kitchen anyway,&rdquo; he evaded.
&ldquo;It was warm down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t eat up my cakes?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;I had trouble enough getting them
baked. The cook says the blockade is to blame
for making sugar so scarce and high. They
ought to know we have to have sugar. There&rsquo;s
no coconut either, nor nutmegs nor cinnamon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s war, Mary. Some good people haven&rsquo;t
even got bread,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>
<p>She began to whimper, perching on the edge
of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t need any cakes for my party.
I&rsquo;ve had at least a dozen regrets already. An
invitation from the wife of the President
should be like a command from the queen,&rdquo;
she declared, grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving all those insulting
notes and I think the people who wrote
them should be properly dealt with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln sighed as he hung up his coat and
untied his lumpy satin cravat. The starched
collar rasped his neck. He was glad to be rid of
it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you cry now for Christmas, Mary,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
he pleaded. &ldquo;We have to keep things happy for
the boys. Bob will be here in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dried her eyes on the ruffle of her sleeve.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help remembering that I&rsquo;ve lost my
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of a vast company, Mary. If all
the tears that will be shed by bereaved mothers
tomorrow were drained into one river we could
float a gunboat on it. If only I could see a way
so there would be no more&mdash;no more killing, no
more graves, no more sorrowing women!&rdquo; he
cried, desolately.</p>
<p>It was a cry of anguish and Mary Lincoln felt
a surge of terrible compassion for this gaunt,
lonely man who was her love. She put her arms
around him, standing on tiptoe, her cheek
pressing the buttons of his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t make this war. You&rsquo;re doing all
any man could do to end it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We
could have ignored the country&mdash;we could have
stayed in Springfield where nobody hated us.
Here they all hate us. The ones who come to
our party tomorrow will smirk and fawn to our
faces and then sneer at our backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all, Mary. There are plenty of good
folks, loyal folks, who believe I&rsquo;m doing right.
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Plenty of people we can call our friends. A
sight of them voted for me, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want something!&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;Every
last one of them wants something. That General
Grant is even being puffed up to run
against you for president next year. Even the
Illinois newspapers are for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he might make a good president,&rdquo; admitted
Lincoln, &ldquo;though no soldier ever has
made a good president since George Washington.
And if I&rsquo;m beat, we can always go home to
Springfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slink home like beaten dogs!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
her mercurial mood shifting again.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll not do it. They&rsquo;re not going to get
us down, Abraham Lincoln! Democrats nor
Black Republicans either. And they&rsquo;d better
show up at my party if they want any more
favors from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tear up those regrets, Mary,&rdquo; he said
soberly. &ldquo;Tear up every single one of &rsquo;em. And
forget the names of the people who wrote them.
That,&rdquo; he added very solemnly, &ldquo;is an order
from the President.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">6</span></h2>
<p>Robert Todd Lincoln was a young
man trying sincerely not to be a snob, not to be
blas&eacute; or obviously aware that his father was
President of the United States. A medium tall,
erect lad, Robert&rsquo;s dark hair was sleeked down
over a head rounded like his mother&rsquo;s, but his
long arms and still growing legs and feet he had
from his father.</p>
<p>That long-tailed coat with braided collar was
too old for Bob, Abraham Lincoln was thinking.
So was his manner too old, a boyish kind of
gravity that obviously he strove to keep from
being condescending. His mother fluttered
about him adoringly as they sat at the family
breakfast table. She was continually straightening
his cravat, feeling his brow anxiously,
smoothing his hair. Lincoln, shrewdly sensitive,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
could see that his older son was a trifle annoyed
by his mother&rsquo;s solicitous attentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob hasn&rsquo;t got a fever, Mama,&rdquo; he interposed
cheerfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the healthiest human
being I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. Why don&rsquo;t we
all go and see what Tad got for Christmas?&rdquo;
He pushed back his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert must get some sleep,&rdquo; argued his
mother. &ldquo;He says he didn&rsquo;t get a wink on that
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cars were cold and smelly and they
were jammed with soldiers, all of them cold
and miserable,&rdquo; stated Robert. &ldquo;Most of them
coming South to join Pope&rsquo;s army and all sulky
because they had to be away from home for
Christmas. One chap sat with me&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
have been any older than I am and he had been
home to Rhode Island to bury his wife. They all
talked and they were plenty bitter against the
bounty boys&mdash;those fellows who bought their
way out of the draft for three hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a compromise and an evil one, I
fear,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;Everything about war is
evil. You can only contrive and pray for ways
to make it a little less evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert stood up. His face was very white.
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
&ldquo;Pa&mdash;and Mama&mdash;I told lies coming down on
that train. I told them I was coming home to
enlist. I&rsquo;ve got to get into the Army&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got
to! Those men on that train, they were dirty
and shabby and some hadn&rsquo;t shaved or washed
in a long time, and most of them were rough
and some ignorant but every one of them was
a better man than I was! I could feel them looking
at me&mdash;with contempt at first. It was in
every man&rsquo;s mind that I was a bounty boy. A
shirker. Hiding behind a screen of cash! I was
thankful nobody knew my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have told them your name,&rdquo; insisted
his mother. &ldquo;You could have made them
respect you as the son of the President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mary&mdash;no, no!&rdquo; protested Lincoln. &ldquo;Bob
couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not? Certainly your family
are entitled to respect, Abraham Lincoln!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Mama,&rdquo; said Robert
unhappily. &ldquo;I was thankful I&rsquo;d been able to
duck away from those soldiers Mr. Stanton had
detailed in New York. I didn&rsquo;t want to be
Robert Lincoln. I wanted to be nobody. Then
when I got off here in Washington, there was
that escort! Troops to guard me, as though I
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
were a crown prince or something. A coward
of a prince!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Mary upset her cup in her agitation.
&ldquo;I still say you must finish your education.
You must graduate from Harvard. You&rsquo;ll be
much more valuable to the country as an educated
man than just another private in the
army. Even if your father gave you a commission&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a commission. Not if it has to
be given to me,&rdquo; Robert cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d deserve all
the contempt I saw in some of those men&rsquo;s
faces if I took a commission I hadn&rsquo;t earned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s face relaxed in a slow smile. There
were times when his older son troubled him,
but now a quiet pride warmed his spirit. But
his heart sank again when he saw the stony set
of Mary&rsquo;s mouth, the flush that always heated
her face when she was angry and determined
to carry her point. She would not change. Her
attitude was the same as that with which she
had faced down General Sickles and Senator
Harris not too long ago. They had inquired,
coldly, why Robert was not in the service. The
boy should, declared the General, have been
in uniform long since. Mary had talked them
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
down then, firmly, just as she would talk down
all Robert&rsquo;s arguments now. But it was a joy to
Lincoln that Robert did have pride and perhaps
a mind of his own.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes were already glittering behind
their pale lashes. Now the shine was exasperation
but in a moment, after her fashion, it
would melt into tears. Robert&rsquo;s chin was jutting
and his hands trembled on the back of his chair.
Lincoln interposed quickly trying to ease the
tension, gain a postponement of a crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk this over later,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not spoil Christmas morning with
an argument. Did Tad eat any breakfast,
Mama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Mary got her control back
with a gusty breath. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t even take
time to drink his milk. He took it with him and
likely he&rsquo;s upset the glass all over the carpet by
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go and see what he found under
the Christmas tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert followed them, silently, up the stairs
to the sitting room, strewn now with paper
wrappings and a confusion of toys. Tad was
standing in the middle of the floor buckling on
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
a wide military belt trimmed with metal. Hanging
from it was a small sword. Tad worked
awkwardly because his hands were lost in great
white gauntlet gloves that reached almost to
his elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Stanton,&rdquo; he grinned, patting the
belt. &ldquo;I thought he didn&rsquo;t like me. I thought he
didn&rsquo;t like boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes being Secretary of War,&rdquo; said
Robert dryly. He reached for a small package.
&ldquo;This is for you, Mama. The man said these
things were real jade from China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary took the parcel eagerly, kissed Robert,
undid the wrapping, exclaimed over the necklace,
pin, and earbobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob, they&rsquo;re so pretty! I can wear them
with my green taffeta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a child for trinkets, Lincoln was
thinking indulgently. He was glad that he had
given her the big white muff. She would love
carrying it to parties and on their carriage
drives, nestling her two little round chins into
the delicate fur. He thanked Robert for a pair
of gold cuff links and there was laughter when
they discovered that his gift to Robert had been
an almost identical pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Robert, &ldquo;I shall have the distinction
of imitating the President of the United
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll fasten your shirt sleeves anyway,&rdquo;
drawled Lincoln. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all a man can
ask of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad strutted around the room flourishing his
sword. He gulped the last of his milk hastily
at his mother&rsquo;s command, put on his uniform
cap, and swished a shine on the toes of his boots
with his cuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have to show these to the boys,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But son,&rdquo; protested his mother, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you
going to play with all your pretty toys? Look&mdash;this
little cannon. It shoots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh&mdash;shoots a cork!&rdquo; Tad dismissed the
weapon indifferently, &ldquo;A ole Rebel would sure
laugh if you shot him with that. Papa, I want
a real gun. One with bullets in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Heaven, Tad, you&rsquo;re too little to have a
gun,&rdquo; declared Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a gun I could ride with Papa and
perteck him,&rdquo; argued Tad. &ldquo;Then nobody
would dare shoot holes in his hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln caught the startled look on Mary&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
face, got his son hastily by the elbow. &ldquo;Come
along, Tad. Go show off your finery. And I&rsquo;ve
got work to do.&rdquo; He hustled the boy down the
hall. &ldquo;Who told you somebody shot a hole in my
hat?&rdquo; he demanded, when they were out of earshot.</p>
<p>Tad grinned. &ldquo;Oh, I get information,&rdquo; he
said blandly, &ldquo;but if I had been along with a
good ole gun nobody would have dared do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it again in front of your
mother, you hear?&rdquo; Lincoln seldom spoke
sharply to the boy and Tad looked scared
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;no, sir, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he stammered, his
palate tripping him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind now! And get along with you!&rdquo; His
father gave him a little shove, as he entered the
office door.</p>
<p>Even on a holiday he was not free from intrusion,
of being faced with the woeful problems
of the people. A lad of about seventeen,
in the faded uniform of a private, was standing,
twisting thin hands together, his face scared
and anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, son,&rdquo; ordered Lincoln, closing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
door. &ldquo;How did you get in here and what did
you want to see me about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy dropped on the edge of a chair,
twisted his legs about each other nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody let me in, sir,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I
just told the man downstairs that I had to see
the President and he searched me, and I didn&rsquo;t
have no gun or nothing so he told me to come
on up here and wait. And what I wanted to see
you about, Mr. President&mdash;I want to be a captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s long lips drew back and quirked
up a little at one corner. &ldquo;I see. And what military
organization did you want to be captain
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No organization, Mr. President, but I been
a private in the Sixty-third Ohio a long time,
sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four months, Mr. President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have a company organized, maybe,
that you want me to make you captain of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got any company organized.
But I just want to be a captain. My mother
says I should be a captain. She told me to see
you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Lincoln clasped his bony hands around a
knee. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milo, sir. Milo Potter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milo, did you ever hear the story about the
farmer out in Illinois, where I was raised? Well,
this fellow he was a good farmer and a dutiful
son to his mother but he got up towards forty
years old and he&rsquo;d never married a wife. So his
mother fretted at him, said she was getting too
old to churn and milk and he ought to fetch a
wife home to take some of the work off of her.
So this farmer, call him Jim, he goes down to
the church and hunts up the preacher.
&lsquo;Preacher&rsquo;, says Jim &lsquo;I got to get married.
Mammy says so.&rsquo; &lsquo;All right, Jim,&rsquo; agrees the
preacher, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be proud to marry you. You go
get your license and bring the woman here with
you and I&rsquo;ll give you a real good marrying.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got any woman, Preacher,&rsquo; Jim
argues kind of dashed. &lsquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t get married
without a woman, Jim&rsquo;, the preacher tells
him. That&rsquo;s your problem, Milo. You want to
be a captain and you haven&rsquo;t got any organization
to captain. What made you think you
could be a captain, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. President,&rdquo; the boy flushed unhappily,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
&ldquo;it was that captain we got in B Company.
That last battle&mdash;he made us retreat. And
right there in front of us there was a hole in
that Rebel line I could have drove four wagons
through. There wasn&rsquo;t no sense in that retreat,
Mr. President. All of us boys said so. All of
us was mad. So I thought I can be a better
captain than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can, Milo. You go on back to B
Company and be a good soldier and likely
you&rsquo;ll make captain before this war is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President, I can&rsquo;t do it! I run off. They&rsquo;ll
put me in the guardhouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln scratched his chin. &ldquo;That was very
unwise of you, soldier. But you can&rsquo;t dodge
your military responsibility. I reckon you&rsquo;ll just
have to go to the guardhouse. If you should try
to hedge out of it you&rsquo;d be as poor a soldier as
that captain of B Company you complain about.
It won&rsquo;t be too bad. Good luck to you, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said, &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; and backed
out, twisting his cap in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up straight, look the captain in the
eye, and admit you ran off, son,&rdquo; advised Lincoln.
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell him you came here to get
his job away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I sure won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Hay came in when the young trooper
had gone. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let him in perhaps,
Mr. President,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but he said he
had an important message for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was important. To Milo Potter,&rdquo; smiled
Lincoln. &ldquo;No harm done, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son is waiting, sir. Shall I send him
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be Bob. Tad would have already been
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert came in, took a chair, and folded his
hands, his young mouth sober. &ldquo;I had to know,
sir,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;have they been making attempts
to kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, there are several million people who
think that the man who kills me should wear a
hero&rsquo;s crown. And there are a lot of people who
yearn to be heroes,&rdquo; Lincoln said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be better protected. You
shouldn&rsquo;t take risks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to protect me now, Bob, till
I can&rsquo;t hardly draw my own breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow who just went out. Did you even
know him?&rdquo; persisted the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was harmless. I reckon Johnny even took
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
his jackknife away from him. I have to see &rsquo;em,
son. I have to hear their story. That&rsquo;s why they
put me here,&rdquo; declared his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the Army, Papa&mdash;I&rsquo;m deadly serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is, Bob, that your mother is
deadly serious, too. She&rsquo;s lost two boys,&rdquo; Lincoln
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have other women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Give her a little more time, Bob.
Till the end of this year anyway. The war isn&rsquo;t
going to end before New Years&rsquo; Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t wait much longer, I promise you,&rdquo;
threatened Robert, standing tall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just promise me to the end of this school
year. Then we&rsquo;ll talk about it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll talk to Mama? Make her see that
it&rsquo;s something I have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Mama,&rdquo; agreed Abraham Lincoln.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when, he was thinking wearily after the
boy had gone, had his best ever been good
enough to prevail against Mary&rsquo;s ready tears?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">7</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; Abraham Lincoln said, when he
went back to the family rooms, &ldquo;I need some
help. Your mother has very graciously provided
some little Christmas cheer for those boys out
there of Company K. The things are all here in
this big box. I&rsquo;ll need you to help pass &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent and shouldered the heavy box that
Mary had packed with small, paper-wrapped
bundles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa, let me call somebody! You
shouldn&rsquo;t carry that,&rdquo; protested Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough to do for those boys.&rdquo; Lincoln
bent under the burden. &ldquo;It will mean more to
them if I fetch it to them personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; fumed Mary. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beneath
your dignity to lug that heavy box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put my hat on, Mary, and put it on tight so
I won&rsquo;t knock it off.&rdquo; He ignored her protest
calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>She jammed the high hat down over his
rough hair, the bony knobs of his head. &ldquo;You&mdash;the
President of the United States!&rdquo; she exploded.
&ldquo;With a house full of help and you lug
that heavy thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who would be greatest among you, let
him seek out the lowest place,&rdquo; quoted Lincoln,
solemnly and a bit inaccurately. &ldquo;Not near so
heavy as a good stout oak rail and I&rsquo;ve shouldered
many of them in my day. Come along,
Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least let me help carry, sir,&rdquo; argued Robert
as they went down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it or you&rsquo;ll get it unbalanced
and spill all Company K&rsquo;s Christmas. Little
enough, but I had John Hay fetch me a roll of
greenbacks. I&rsquo;ll give every man a dollar. A dollar
is a right substantial present, Bob, when
you&rsquo;re marching and fighting for thirteen dollars
a month and what you can eat, when you
get a chance to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would do it gladly,&rdquo; insisted Robert. &ldquo;All
I ask is a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, son. Maybe we can talk your mother
around by spring. I did some better in the
Black Hawk War.&rdquo; Lincoln went on, stepping
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
heavily down the outer steps and across the
rutted yard. &ldquo;They paid me eighty-five dollars
for ninety days fighting in that war but part of
the time I ranked a captain. We had to shoot
hogs to eat, though, and then fight the farmers
that owned &rsquo;em. Swampy country, too.
Like Grant&rsquo;s army fought over around Vicksburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you captured Black Hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The regular Army said they did that. I got
put in the guardhouse for two days for firing a
pistol in camp and they made me carry a
wooden sword after that. Discipline. You
couldn&rsquo;t make any worse record in the army,
Bob, than your father did before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t call that a real war, Papa,&rdquo;
Robert said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was real enough to the men who got their
scalps peeled off. I helped bury twelve of them.
Now, look at that lieutenant! Sending an escort
up here on the double and putting all those
boys in line at attention, when I just came out
here on a friendly visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even Tad!&rdquo; laughed Robert. &ldquo;Even the confounded
goat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goat wore his military hat and Tad was
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
holding him grimly into line by his horns. Lincoln
let the two soldiers who came trotting up
help him ease the box down to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ease, men,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;This is old
Father Christmas, not the commander in chief.
File by, one at a time, and get your Christmas
cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert passed out the packages one by one
while Lincoln stood thumbing bills off a roll of
money, stopping to wet his thumb occasionally,
saying, &ldquo;Here, son, spend this on some foolishness
next time you get a pass into town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were yells of thanks and a lined-up
cheer for the President, the goat blatting an
obligato. But Tad, who had straggled at the
end of the line and received nothing, glared
down into the empty box, whimpering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a soldier. I didn&rsquo;t get any present,&rdquo; he
complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got plenty of presents at the house,
Tad,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got candy there,
too. Don&rsquo;t you go bumming off these boys now.
You have more Christmas than any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want a soldier Christmas,&rdquo; persisted
Tad, &ldquo;and I want my nanny goat back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a goat,&rdquo; scolded Robert, &ldquo;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
blamed nuisance of a goat. You&rsquo;re getting so
you even smell like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s clean,&rdquo; fumed Tad. &ldquo;Joe washed him
and curried him and the corporal even put hair
oil on his whiskers. Can I take Billy in the
house, Papa? Can I? I want him to have some
candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tad, no more goats in the house. That&rsquo;s
your mother&rsquo;s order. Last time,&rdquo; Lincoln explained
to Robert, &ldquo;Tad drove two of them,
hitched to a chair, right through the middle of
one of your mother&rsquo;s social shindigs. Upset a
couple of ladies and spilled claret punch on
their dresses. Disgraced the whole Lincoln family
and busted some good crockery too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold out here! Billy&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo; Tad hung to
his father&rsquo;s coattail but refused to let go the
goat. &ldquo;Billy will catch cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Bullitt,&rdquo; ordered Lincoln, &ldquo;will you
tie up this goat in a sheltered place? Tad, you
come along inside. You&rsquo;ll get the sniffles and
your mother will scold all of us. Corporal, if you
must provide escort for this family to their door,
line &rsquo;em up. We&rsquo;re ready to march.&rdquo; Lincoln
took a military stance, between two privates,
who were very rigid with importance. Tad
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
pulled back till Robert gave him a gentle,
brotherly cuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You act more like a baby than a colonel,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If you want to cry, hand over that sword.
You&rsquo;ll disgrace the army, bawling on the
march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let loose of me!&rdquo; shrilled Tad, jerking away.
Turning he ran pelting back to the circle of
tents, dove into one and vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go after him, Bob,&rdquo; worried the
President. &ldquo;Your Mama will worry if he&rsquo;s out in
this cold too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Robert, unenthusiastically,
&ldquo;but If I may make a suggestion, sir, that
boy needs discipline. He&rsquo;s getting out of
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I stand reproved, sir,&rdquo; said Lincoln
meekly. &ldquo;Just fetch him along in. I&rsquo;ll wait here,&rdquo;
he told the escorting privates. &ldquo;Stand at
ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President, I hope Tad don&rsquo;t run off
again,&rdquo; worried one soldier. &ldquo;We try not to take
our eyes off him when he&rsquo;s out here with us.
Could be some Rebel sympathizers hangin&rsquo;
round that would think it was a smart move to
catch up Tad and hold him. Know you&rsquo;d be
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
mighty near be willing to surrender Washington
to get that boy back, your pardon, sir, for
speaking so bold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panic stiffened Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s long body.
He broke into a long-legged trot back toward
the tents, the escort panting after him. Robert
emerged, pale-faced, from one tent and, with a
dozen soldiers charging after him, hurried into
another. He came out again, his hands outspread,
helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hiding somewhere, Papa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spread out, men!&rdquo; shouted the lieutenant.
&ldquo;Comb the area. Six of you guard the President.
Corporal Barnes, form a guard detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal hustled Robert into the middle
of the protecting group, who faced outward
bayonets alerted. Robert was angry and full of
expostulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to be guarded like a prisoner,&rdquo;
he protested. &ldquo;I want to go and help search for
Tad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Bullitt, here, has just made a rather
startling suggestion, Bob,&rdquo; said Lincoln worriedly.
&ldquo;He thinks that if some Rebel sympathizer
should catch up Tad and hold him I
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
might be pressured into surrendering Washington
to get the boy back. And it might be,&rdquo;
he added sadly, &ldquo;that I would be weak enough
to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never would! You couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;with
honor!&rdquo; explained Robert. &ldquo;But it would be a
mighty tough decision, sir. Is that,&rdquo; he asked
sharply, &ldquo;why you won&rsquo;t let me go into the
Army? For fear I might be captured and held
as a hostage to force some concessions out of
you? I want to tell you, sir, that if I can get into
the Army&mdash;and no matter how I&rsquo;m treated there
or what happens to me, I&rsquo;ll be a United States
soldier, Mr. Lincoln&mdash;you can forget that I ever
was your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nobly said, son,&rdquo; Lincoln patted his
shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to abide by your decision if
the occasion ever arises. But Tad is my son. A
little helpless boy. A boy I&rsquo;m mighty fond of,
and they know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may speak plainly again, sir,&rdquo; said Robert,
&ldquo;he needs his breeches tanned. And you are
the one who ought to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have gone far,&rdquo; fretted Lincoln.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to snow again.&rdquo; He moved
across the yard, his escort keeping rigidly in
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
formation on either side. &ldquo;Tad!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;You, Tad&mdash;come back here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to be a soldier, Mr. President,&rdquo;
put in one of the soldiers. &ldquo;Tad was bound he
was a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my boys,&rdquo; said Lincoln, &ldquo;wanting to be
soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a shout presently from beyond the
fenced in confines of the yard. Men started running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen him,&rdquo; cried Robert relieved.
&ldquo;The ornery little devil!&rdquo; He began to run himself,
and Lincoln trotted too, almost outstripping
his guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; exclaimed a soldier. &ldquo;Up on
that scaffolding again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going after him. They&rsquo;ll get him
down.&rdquo; Lincoln almost forgot to breathe. The
little figure looked so small against the loom of
that great half-finished monument&mdash;a tiny,
struggling shape swarmed over by half a dozen
men in blue who clung precariously to the
spidery trestles, caught him and passed him
down slowly, kicking and fighting, from one to
another.</p>
<p>They brought him up in a few minutes, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
pathetic, disheveled sight, tear-stained, dragging
his feet, still kicking at the shins of the
men who restrained him. His military cap was
over one eye, his belt half off, the toy sword
dragging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch him here!&rdquo; sternly ordered the President
of the United States.</p>
<p>Tad stumbled close, held tight by the elbows
by two privates. His chin was shaking, sobs
shook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa&mdash;Oh, Papa&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped, trying to
fling himself at the tall man with the suddenly
grim and forbidding face.</p>
<p>But Lincoln was unrelenting. &ldquo;Thomas Lincoln!
Give me that sword!&rdquo; he ordered in a terrible
voice.</p>
<p>Trembling Tad jerked the sword loose,
handed it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present the hilt, in proper military order!&rdquo;
snapped his father.</p>
<p>Tad reversed the sword, his hand shaking so
that almost it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; His voice was very thin and small.</p>
<p>Solemnly Lincoln broke the sword over his
knee, tossed it to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are now reduced to the rank of private,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
Thomas Lincoln,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;until such time
as you can conduct yourself in the proper manner
and discipline of an officer of the Army of
the United States. Strip off his epaulets, Corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal obeyed, looking unhappy and
ill at ease, handing the gold-fringed boards into
the hands of the commander in chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Thomas Lincoln, you will now escort
the President of the United States back to
the White House,&rdquo; ordered Abraham Lincoln.
&ldquo;Forward march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man of Company K fell in, marched
in grave formation, eyes straight ahead, chins
set, weapons held ready, to the side door of the
house. Lincoln entered first, turned on the doorstep,
and soberly saluted the ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My deepest gratitude, men of Company
K,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for labor beyond the call of
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad marched in stiffly; then, with a frightened
look backward at this stranger who had
been his adored and indulgent father, flew
through the hall and up the stairs. His mother
came hurrying out of the sitting room but he
ignored her, flying past her to the room with
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
the great high-topped bed. There Private
Thomas Lincoln dived under the bed.</p>
<p>When the dinner gong sounded, he refused
to come out, even at his father&rsquo;s stern order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; dismissed Abraham Lincoln.
&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re such a craven and a coward, Private
Lincoln, you may remain in durance there.
I can eat two drumsticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tad rolled out, swiftly, covered with dust
and lint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a coward!&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;I climbed
most to the top of that silly ole monument!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still a disgrace to the uniform,&rdquo; declared
his father. &ldquo;A soldier who ran away. Now
go and wash yourself before your mother comes
in here and scolds both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Papa dear!&rdquo; whimpered Tad, hugging
the long legs and snuffling. &ldquo;And you can have
both drumsticks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">8</span></h2>
<p>The Christmas party was in full swing.
Abraham Lincoln had shaken hands till his
knuckles ached. Mary Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s coral-colored
satin and turbaned headdress with
jaunty flowers and feathers had swished and
bowed and rustled, and her round face was all
aglow with pleasure and excitement. She was
always vivacious at parties, and, if at times she
was a bit too garrulous, Lincoln overlooked
that indulgently. He had not given Mary much
of happiness, and she had had her share of
frustration and sorrow. Now, if she could find
pleasure in the dull round of an official affair,
he was content.</p>
<p>Some of the senators and other officials had
had a few too many parties already. One judge
was already asleep on a padded sofa in the hall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
his gaited ankles sprawling, his mouth open.
The musicians from the Marine Band played on
doggedly and quietly in the screened corner of
the East Room. Here and there stood men of
Company K and White House guards, stony-faced,
rigidly alerted. Abraham Lincoln felt his
legs begin to sag a bit under him, found himself
wishing wearily that this company would all
go home. But at least Mary was enjoying herself.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when an aide came
through the crowd, and touched the arm of the
President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some men of Company K at the rear door,
Mr. President,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;They
insist on seeing you. An officer is with them.
They say they have brought a Christmas present
for your son, Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lincoln looked about him. Mary was the animated
center of a group. Servants were collecting
empty glasses and picking up shattered
remnants of flowers from the carpet. Secretary
Seward stood in the midst of a dozen men who
were arguing a trifle too loudly the question of
amnesty for North Carolina. The band was
playing slowly, with a few sour notes indicating
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
that the musicians were wearying after five
hours of patient tootling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismiss those Marine players,&rdquo; ordered Lincoln.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tired. I&rsquo;ll see what those boys at
the back door want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone, Mr. President!&rdquo; protested the
aide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Company K won&rsquo;t let anything happen to
me,&rdquo; argued Lincoln. &ldquo;How many are out
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a number, sir. A lieutenant is with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch Tad. If they&rsquo;ve brought something
for him it will sort of make up for this sorry
Christmas he had.&rdquo; Lincoln strode off up the
stairs. All day since disciplining Tad his heart
had ached in dull, heavy fashion. It was not
easy, he was thinking, to be the son of a president.
It was not even easy to be a president.
He thought again wistfully of that white house
in Springfield, of turkey wishbones hung to dry
there above the kitchen stove when Tad and
Willie were small. Honors came dear. Almost,
he decided, a man could pay too much for
them.</p>
<p>Tad was still awake, lying hunched down in
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
the middle of the huge, high bed. A candle
burned on a stand, and the flickering light made
his eyes enormous and somehow lost in the
round paleness of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep, Papa,&rdquo; he explained,
scrabbling into his father&rsquo;s lap when Lincoln
sat on the edge of the bed. &ldquo;It was the drum.
I could hear it all the time&mdash;bum, bum. When
it stopped I waited for it to start again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stopped now, Tad. For good. And the
boys are downstairs. Our boys. They brought
you something. Come on, I&rsquo;ll carry you down.
Put this wrapper around you so you won&rsquo;t take
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a new sword. Would you let me
wear it, Papa?&rdquo; asked Tad eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see how you behave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down the rear stairway stealthily,
through a chilly hall to the back door. But even
here was an aide who sprang to open the door
and two soldiers appeared out of nowhere, one
desperately swallowing some thing he had been
chewing on.</p>
<p>On the steps outside huddled a crowd of
blue-clad men. Snow sifted thinly over their
bent shoulders, their drawn-down caps. Every
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
face came up, but to a man they seemed to be
holding something, holding tight to a bulk that
struggled a little, something that was hairy and
odorous and staccato of feet and alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; the lieutenant jerked erect,
saluted anxiously, &ldquo;we brought this&mdash;for Private
Thomas Lincoln&mdash;for his Christmas, sir.
It&rsquo;s not the same one. Some of the boys chipped
in and bought it off a Negro, sir&mdash;but we thought
might be it would do&mdash;for the boy for his Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a fish Tad was out of his father&rsquo;s arms,
nightshirt flying, bare feet oblivious of the cold
stone step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nanny goat!&rdquo; he shrieked in delight.
&ldquo;Papa, it&rsquo;s a nanny goat! My very own nanny
goat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President, your pardon sir, it&rsquo;s kind of
dirty, sir, but we&rsquo;ll wash it good in the morning.
And though it ain&rsquo;t the same one,&rdquo; pleaded
the corporal, &ldquo;we thought maybe it would do&mdash;for
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She licked my hand. She likes me!&rdquo; Tad
squirmed in ecstasy. &ldquo;Most of anything I
wanted me a nanny goat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; stated Abraham Lincoln, &ldquo;to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
a very superior goat. Thank the boys, Tad, and
let them take your nanny down to the stables
and feed her. She looks a bit gaunt to me. See
that she gets a good feed, Corporal, if you
please. Now, back to bed, Private Lincoln.
Your nanny will still be here, all cleaned up
and beautiful for you, in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very reluctantly, with many farewell pats
and hand lickings, Tad was at last persuaded
to mount the stairs again in his father&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Down below, the drums had ceased but
Abraham Lincoln thought wearily of all the
hands he must shake again before he could lie
down to rest in this wide bed.</p>
<p>He tucked the covers tenderly over the
happy child. Tad&rsquo;s eyes were starry. No more
tears. All sadness forgotten. Wonderful, to be
a child. Abraham Lincoln sighed as he closed
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; called Tad.</p>
<p>Lincoln opened the door again. &ldquo;Yes, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nicest Christmas I ever had!&rdquo; stated
young Thomas Lincoln.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
